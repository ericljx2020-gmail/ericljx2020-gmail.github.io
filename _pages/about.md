## Academic Journey & AI Passion

My academic journey reflects my commitment to excellence, maintaining a perfect 4.0 GPA while pursuing a challenging dual major. I've excelled in advanced coursework spanning Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, Computer Systems, and Deep Learning. My completion of Stanford's Online Deep Learning specialization with a perfect score (100/100) further demonstrates my dedication to mastering AI technologies.

## Professional Experience & Projects

My professional experience spans across cutting-edge AI and software development roles. At Afanti.ai, I developed multi-agent systems that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance AI-powered education. This work not only improved problem-solving accuracy but also made AI explanations more comprehensible and human-centric.

At Zilliz, I'm currently working on innovative solutions that bridge the gap between semantic search and community knowledge sharing. My work involves developing automated pipelines that enhance the accessibility and quality of technical information, demonstrating my ability to apply AI technologies to real-world challenges.

## Research & Innovation

As an Undergraduate Researcher at UCSD's SuperComputer Center, I'm exploring the frontiers of network security and anomaly detection. My work with Papermill and Apache Spark showcases my ability to handle large-scale data processing and analysis. I'm particularly proud of my contributions to an anomaly detection paper that combines BGP data analysis with flow tuple processing.

## Looking Forward

I'm constantly seeking opportunities to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI and software engineering. Whether it's developing more intuitive user interfaces at Mercury Health or creating sophisticated game engines, I approach each project with enthusiasm and a growth mindset.

My goal is to contribute to the advancement of AI technology while making it more accessible and beneficial to society. I'm particularly interested in:
- Large Language Models and their applications
- Multi-agent AI systems
- Semantic search and information retrieval
- Machine learning for security and anomaly detection

I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative projects and learn from fellow technology enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss potential collaborations!
